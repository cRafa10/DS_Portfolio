# Hi, I'm Carlos – Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a data enthusiast who loves turning messy data into meaningful insights and compelling stories. This portfolio highlights some of the data science and analytics projects I’ve worked on—ranging from exploratory analysis and machine learning to dashboard visualizations and real-world business case studies.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

- **End-to-End Projects** – From data wrangling to model deployment
- **Real-World Business Cases** – Customer churn, market analysis, A/B testing, and more
- **Interactive Dashboards** – Built with Tableau, Power BI, or Python/Streamlit
- **Clean Code & Notebooks** – Jupyter, Python, SQL—all documented for clarity
- **Storytelling** – Every project focuses not just on results, but *why* it matters

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Languages & Libraries**:  
`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Matplotlib`, `SQL`, `Power BI`, `Tableau`, `Streamlit`, `Pytorch`

**Workflow**:  
Data Cleaning → EDA → Modeling → Evaluation → Visualization → Business Impact

## 🧠 Featured Projects

- **VGG & Residual Neural Network Models**  
  VGG neural network model and a residual neural network models feeding a CIFAR-10 dataset. End goal was to let my program be able to identify the content of the images that were given and to classify them into related groups.
